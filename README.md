# SITL-6-Arduino-Uno-Interfacing
Interfacing Ardunio in Simulink witth DHT11 and Ultrasonic sensor </br>

We Interfaced Ultrasonic sensor and found out the distance between the sensor and object and also a alarm rings if object comes near to the sensor.
</br>We also interfaced DHT 11 sensor to gives the readings of Temperature and humidity .
